## Blasphemous Skin Selector

Quick script to randomly select a skin from the user's Blasphemous skins folder.

Will still need to go into the game and select the given skin - this was simply built because I'm indecisive.

Assumes that the location containing the skins is `'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blasphemous\Modding\skins'`, but this location can be modified with a command-line argument.
